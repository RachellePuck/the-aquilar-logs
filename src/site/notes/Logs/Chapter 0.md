After welding up a great ship, docked in the [[Locations/Ship City/Aluminum Bay/Aluminum Bay\|Aluminum Bay]], [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] makes her way to the cantina. There, a messenger tells her she's expected at the [[Locations/Ship City/The Chasm/Vermillion House\|Vermillion House]]. She finishes her meal, and goes home for a quick shower before reporting to the guild.

Made her way to [[Locations/Ship City/The Chasm/The Chasm\|The Chasm]], to the guild. Greeted by an older woman, [[NPC's/Ship City/Layla\|Layla]], who tells her the master is expecting her. [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]] invites her in the office, a huge map on the wall portraying the know star system.

She asks about [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava's]] work, and tells her she's not the only one having trouble finding exploring work. [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]] has a proposition for her to be part of a new crew, funded by the [[Guilds/Explorers Guild\|Explorers Guild]]. On the surface [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] would be training some people that were new to the guild, taking on the role of Senior Explorer, but really she would be gathering intel. [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]] says the rookie has just arrived and [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] should pick her up from the harbour and bring her to the [[Locations/Ship City/The Chasm/Vermillion House\|Vermillion House]]. She ask for a description to find her and gets a note with a picture and the name [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene Dara]].

It doesn't take long for [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] to find [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] in Hull Town. She glares at the vendor harassing [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]], and ask if she's the person [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] is looking for. She confirms and tells me she's supposed to meet with [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]], so [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] lead her back to the guild and introduce myself.

They arrive at the guild, where [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] registers her name with [[NPC's/Ship City/Layla\|Layla]]. As she mentions her last name, [[NPC's/Ship City/Layla\|Layla]] shows almost a bit of contempt, a little scoff. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] leads [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] upstairs to [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]]'s office, where [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] is asked to give them a moment alone.

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] stood next to the door agains the wall, and managed to overhear some things about [[Locations/Barrabas\|Barrabas]], exile, and [[Hamurabi\|Hamurabi]], but nothing concrete. When [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] exits, she's asked to enter the office, where [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]] informed her that in a week they are to work with the [[Guilds/Navigators Guild\|Navigators Guild]] customs, and board the [[Zelos\|Zelos]], which will go on its way to [[Locations/Gamaru\|Gamaru]]. The [[Guilds/Explorers Guild\|Explorers Guild]] had lost contact with an explorer group there, and they are meant to find them under the guise of training the rookies. They are supposed to report to [[Ordana Station\|Ordana Station]], an [[Guilds/Explorers Guild\|Explorers Guild]] branch on [[Locations/Gamaru\|Gamaru]]. [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]] says another person is supposed to join the crew, but she doesn't know when they will arrive yet.
