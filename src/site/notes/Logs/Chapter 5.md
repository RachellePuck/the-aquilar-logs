*12-01-2026*

The following evening the group meets back up in the second lounge, where [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] goes to network with the rich people there. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] talk about his [[Lore/Garuda\|Garuda]], [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]], and her training of the junior explorers. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] is very excited about the prospect of joining [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]]'s theory lessons with the juniors, and will probably join the following day to share his theoretical expertise on the construction of ancient [[Lore/The Builders\|Builder]] ruins.

[[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] listens in on some [[Lore/The Coriolites/The Coriolites\|Coriolites]] talking about their destination being Hasingtow(?), while working on some art. As the evening bell rings, [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] makes sure to loudly admire [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]]'s art to make her more interesting to the rest of the [[Lore/The Coriolites/The Coriolites\|Coriolites]] on the ship.

As [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] gets to his room, he sees a small note, slid under his door.

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] dreams of the maze halls again. If feels weird how soon after the last dream it is, however, this time it feels different. The space is devoid of everything, except for the feeling of being watched by something omnipresent. Walking around, she realises she is in a pretty well-mapped area, but the feeling of being watched follows. She looks around and calls out to whoever is there. There is no reaction, but she feels the watching coming from the sky. She looks up, and the umbra of the sky is replace by a huge, almost black, iris. She stumbles back, and wakes up, immediately journalling what she saw.

[[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] wakes up seeing the purple/magenta haze. She realises the only place she's seen it before is the eyes behind the mask on [[Davoudon\|Davoudon]].

During breakfast, [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] asks [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] for help and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] joins them. He recalls how the blight can manifest in a person through eyes turning purple, but then quickly notes that if they don't want him there he can leave them and go read. It seems like he tends to feel like he is not wanted.

They wave [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] over to help confront [[Davoudon\|Davoudon]] about probably being in [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]]'s room. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] immediately proposes dressing up and beating him up, as well as breaking into his room. A discussion is had about the angle of approaching [[Davoudon\|Davoudon]]. Since they don't see him in the dining hall, they ask [[Malik\|Malik]] if he knows where to find him. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] goes with an angle on how she's looking for inspiration on death for her art. [[Malik\|Malik]] wonders why they are looking for him, stating that [[Davoudon\|Davoudon]] reeks of death. He hasn't seen him, but proposes they speak with the policing force on the ship.

[[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] thinks back to the moment she woke up, nothing seemed to be taken or misplaced, but she did notice a sort of tanginess in the air she could almost taste. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] suggests using [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]] to try and sniff out the blight that seems to have taken hold in [[Davoudon\|Davoudon]]. [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]] and [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] lead up to the engine room, which we were not supposed to go in. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] makes sure to look around  to see if anyone is watching them, and notices a man in full uniform who walks up to them and introduces himself as [[Varon Kell\|Varon Kell]], First Officer of the policing force. He notes that they were about to do something illegal, but [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] convinces him to let them into the engine room, if only to make sure that there's nothing in there. 

Inside the engine room is a zooming that turns to a booming noise. They follow a metal walkway flanked by the massive engines. They follow the smell to where the exhaust would be, and find themselves staring at a wall. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] expects this to be a hidden wall, but can't find a lever or anything to indicate this. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] then starts to inspect the wall with her magnifying glass, and finds a distortion, almost as if something moved in front of her, but [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] finds that the smell is moving away. [[Varon Kell\|Varon]] seems to be unamused by the whole ordeal and implores them to leave.

They decide agains immediately filing a report and try to think of ways to get tangible proof of someone entering Selene's room. To spend the rest of the day, Dorian proposes to find out what the note he got was about. It was sent by [[Ammi Alamasi\|Ammi Alamasi]], mentioning books and to bring friends to cabin 137. 

[[Ammi Alamasi\|Ammi]] opens the door and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] is immediately excited by the books he can see. They talk and she mentions all of them have darkness around them, and it screams. [[Ammi Alamasi\|Ammi]] is an oracle, and she says that they intrigue her. She mentions that they will be tested by the Nine Icons. The Icon that seems to interact most with their follower is the [[Traveler\|Traveler]] or the [[Gambler\|Gambler]]. Dorian notes he likes the [[Dancer\|Dancer]]. He asks if others have been tested by the Icons before, and she mentions [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]]'s grandfather.
