The expedition will leave in a week, in which time [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] should start showing the new recruits around and starting their basic training. It seems [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] is also in need of some clothes since his are in tatters and he doesn't have any spare with him.

[[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] notices that the size of the Guild is way bigger than the amount of people walking around would need. [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] starts filling in his name and information. She sees his full name is "[[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence Dukus]]" from the far colonies, and his previous occupation was miner.

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] starts compiling a list of things needed for the journey. Explorers' handbook, training equipment, specialty lists. It would probably be best to ask [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Orlof\|Master Orlof]], responsible for the archives, or [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Armatalla\|Master Armatalla]], head of the administrative branch. She takes [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] and [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] to the administrative branch to introduce them to [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Armatalla\|Master Armatalla]] as well. She allows me to make a list of the supplies we need, and she hands the rookies small pouches with advance pay for their work.

After that [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] takes them to [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Orlof\|Master Orlof]], a very old man, with small round glasses perched on his nose. He gives the rookies each a book called "The Explorer's Guide to Exploring". 

There is one more master, [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Roudaver\|Master Roudaver]], head of engineering, but he is not very social and would not appreciate random introductions.

Outside the [[Locations/Ship City/Inner Sanctum/Autumn Palace\|Autumn Palace]], [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] meet again. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] goes on about squeezing(?), and apparently she's homeless. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] mentions he is going to [[Locations/Ship City/The Inbetween\|The Inbetween]] and invites her to come. They discuss the assignment [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] got from his aunt. They realise they have very different views on life and knowledge. 

They take the shortest route towards [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]]'s office, and he gets the feeling they were being shadowed by several figures who are closing in on them. They dash into an alley but the figures dash after them and they start to gain fast. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] takes out a welding torch and burns the hinges off a door to a dingy hovel. They head up the stairs to another exit. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] tries to push a wardrobe in the way, but it doesn't budge. They are making good ground and manage to outrun the people following them as they burst out into a street with Greycap presence. To experience the feeling for travel, [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] decides they should visit [[Locations/Ship City/Aluminum Bay/Aluminum Bay\|Aluminum Bay]] and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] follows.

Since they have a week before the journey, [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] takes [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] and [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] to [[Locations/Ship City/Aluminum Bay/The Outpost\|The Outpost]] to get them some drinks. They talk to the proprietor, [[NPC's/Ship City/Engine\|Engine]], who warns the rookies not to get killed. He says handling artefacts can be dangerous and points to a man with a half-molten face who had come into contact with the Blight. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] tells them of her previous expedition and her encounters with the Blight. How it usually shows up as a red glow on flora. They talk to some of the other adventurers in the bar and make introductions. [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] seems to immediately have lost the money he got before because his clothes are filled with holes, so they buy him some cheap workers clothes.

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]], [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]], and [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] made their way to the edge of [[Locations/Ship City/Aluminum Bay/Aluminum Bay\|Aluminum Bay]], to see the Greatship they will be taking on their expedition. The outside is mostly red with with thick golden chains welded on, the red paint going into blue at the back of the ship in a gradient to symbolise a sunset. As [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] is giving a lecture about the workings of the Greatship, [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] and [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] scoot up and start listening and asking questions. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] mentions he is an archeologist and is going on a pilgrimage. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] says she can ask [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]] if they are in need of an archeologist and an artist. They seem to be convinced they are also leaving in a week so we decide to inquire at the [[Guilds/Navigators Guild\|Navigators Guild]].

The group gets approached by a woman in uniform, [[NPC's/Zalos/Captain Atsæmæz\|Captain Atsæmæz]], (she is the second captain not the captain albay) who would be on the Greatship, and thanks [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] for the work she's done on the hull of the ship. The whole group introduces themselves and the Captain says she looks forward to speaking with us more on the journey.

They discuss the Golgayad family, and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] mentions he knows of and admires [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]]'s grandfather [[NPC's/Dacaro Aquilar\|Dacaro Aquilar]]. [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] mentions that she would like to learn more about her own family, and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] knows that her family is associated with the disappearance of a Greatship, the [[Hamurabi\|Hamurabi]]. The first officer of the [[Hamurabi\|Hamurabi]] expedition was called Dara, who was found adrift in an escape pod after the ship was lost. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] promised to do research on her family while she is training for the next week.

At the [[Guilds/Navigators Guild\|Navigators Guild]] we find a list with the manifest for the journey, which does list [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian Golgayad]] and [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica Buttons]]. 

During the week, [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] collects some (fine) tools from her patron for her work. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] looks for books on the Dara name and family. He also attends the last mass before leaving to appease his family. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] spends the week training [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] and [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] in their physicality, to up their endurance for the expedition, [[Locations/The Zalos\|The Zalos]].

At the setting-off day of the voyage, [[Locations/The Zalos\|The Zalos]] is moored at [[Locations/Ship City/The Maw\|The Maw]]. All are checked at the entrance and given a key to a cabin. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] is in a small room like this as well. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] has a very posh room with an entertainment system, her luggage already brought in, and a note welcoming her, and an itinerary attached to it.
