*02-02-2026*

[[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] panics a bit at the mention of [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]]'s grandfather also having been surrounded by darkness, and being dead (aledgedly). [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] knows a lot about oracles, the [[Lore/The Coriolites/Golgayad\|Golgayad]] have 5, the [[Lore/The Coriolites/Alamasy\|Alamasy]] have 2, of which [[Ammi Alamasy\|Ammi Alamasy]] is one, the [[Lore/The Coriolites/Nazar\|Nazar]] have none. The [[Lore/The Coriolites/Golgayad\|Golgayad]] family comes from the old world which had a lot more organised religion, where oracles were some of the most revered people as they were thought to have been blessed by the Icons themselves. Most oracles have some sort of frailty of the mind or body, not tending to live past 50. There is a lot of stigma around oracles and the things they see in [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]], because most claim they can see into the future of the past. 

[[Ammi Alamasy\|Ammi Alamasy]] says they will be tested by the Icons. Everyone is but a cog in the machinations of the Icons, she is merely peering into the surface of what they might have in store. [[Ammi Alamasy\|Ammi]] offers to give [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] a proper reading as well as the rest of the group, but it would have to be the following day, after evening mass. She is walking barefoot, the room covered in carpets. There is a very wide variety of books in this room. The first is an account of the blight, written by the person that first categorised the different kinds of blight. A childrens' book. Mathematical books. Fantasy and Fiction about heroic adventures. But mostly religious texts. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] borrows a book on the ruins, promising to return it the following day. [[Ammi Alamasy\|Ammi Alamasy]] gets tired and asks them to return the next day.

As they exit the cabin, [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] sees a figure turn the corner down the hallway. Someone was watching them exit the room. They follow the figure and as [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] turns the corner she runs into a large man, built like a wall. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] recognises the man, and the slightly less tall woman next to him, as the [[Lore/The Coriolites/Nazar\|Nazar]] twins, [[Andrit\|Andrit]] and [[Belvide\|Belvide]]. They admit to watching the group, exiting the "witch's" cabin, claiming to just be looking out for the safety of the [[Lore/The Coriolites/Golgayad\|Golgayad]] son. They say anywhere the witch goes she brings bad news and disaster. They did the calculations on this and invited the group to discuss them in the second lounge.

[[The Nazar twins\|The Nazar twins]] are very different in build, but have the same brown, flowy hair, brown eyes, and facial structure. They all order drinks and the twins start to explain, in this case it is a woman bringing bad luck, but it can also be an object, being cursed perhaps. [[Belvide\|Belvide]] hands them a small notebook, looking like a journal with dates. It seems to be equations on the answers to life and the universe. All their equations seem to point that trusting an oracle is a bad idea. 

They seem to specifically on this journey to find their way back to the [[Old Horizon\|Old Horizon]], wishing for hospitable planets and temples where everyone can go. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] doesn't think going back is the way to go. They think this [[New Horizon\|New Horizon]] is tainted by the [[Blight\|Blight]], and beyond it is nothing more than death. They think oracles are shaping a future where they themselves have the power to tell everyone what to do. The twins leave, realising they will not come to an understanding with the group.

[[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] reads the book he borrowed and the rest of the day passes. Uneventful.

The next day is another lecture, this one on the White Fields of Albary. A projection of mostly rocks floating in space. These white fields are the lifeblood of [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]], where the water and oxygen comes from. The lecturer gives a warning about a hidden colony of wreckers amongst the ice, then goes into a religious rant on how the fields are related to the [[Traveller\|Traveller]] and the [[Lore/The Icons/Faceless One\|Faceless One]]. Everyone attending gets a pamphlet with information on the White Fields of Albary. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] and [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] know the original wreckers were exiles from [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]].

During breakfast, someone from the staff comes up to [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] with a Ticker from [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]], telling her to keep an eye out for new talent. [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] manages to pass the physical exam, officially making her a junior explorer. [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] however, does not and goes to the bar to drink. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] convinces the waiter to only give him mocktails.

During dinner the entire group sits together, [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]]'s hands being covered in paper cuts from the art she's been making. She shows the group what she made. It is pretty, but [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] is upset about it being made from a book. [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] shows the group a [[Lore/Selene's Note\|note]] she's received in her room a few nights before. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] and [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] know they've seen the phrase in [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]] before. The combination below seems to have a room number, a date, and a time.

After evening mass, the group heads to [[Ammi Alamasy\|Ammi]]'s cabin. There are several cushions placed on the carpets, her sitting on one already, wearing a blindfold. Everyone sits down.
