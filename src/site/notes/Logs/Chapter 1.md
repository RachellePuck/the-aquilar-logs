[[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] entered his father's office, and was told he was shirking his duties and got an ultimatum. Get secluded for a year, or go on a pilgrimage to find the ultimate faith.

[[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] had a conversation with [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]]'s aunt [[NPC's/Ship City/Iulia Golgayad Mirmira\|Iulia Golgayad Mirmira]], who asked her to make a sculpture based on the feeling or essence of the slipstream. Inspired by a journey on a Greatship.

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] goes to do research on the [[Ordana Station\|Ordana Station]]. It's the northern station from [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]], also called the Northern Arm, the first system there is called [[Locations/Gamaru\|Gamaru]]. She digs into the archives to find information about her [[NPC's/Dacaro Aquilar\|grandfather]] going to the system. He was one of the explorers that documented the [[Asrabourne Runnel\|Asrabourne Runnel]], a slipstream dead end. This was very dangerous because there was a possibility of getting stuck at the end and having to travel back for a year.
[[Locations/Gamaru\|Gamaru]] and [[Locations/Gamaru\|Gamaru]] B. A bi-solar system, with two stars.

The front door swings open and a very haphazard looking young man with a tear in his tunic and dirt on his face storms in. He asks if this is [[Locations/Ship City/The Chasm/Vermillion House\|Vermillion House]] and thanks the gods he's arrived at the right place after 4 days of searching. He says he got a letter informing him he has to meet with [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]], but he seems to have lost the letter. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] realised this must be the last member of her crew, and takes him up to [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]]'s office. His name is [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]], and she informs [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Moska]] he's arrived.
