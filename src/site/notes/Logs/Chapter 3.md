*15-12-2025*

The Greatship is supposed to leave at 11:00. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] disembarks for a little bit to see if any of his family is there to see him off, but he doesn't see anyone there.

[[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] is unpacking her things and finds some things she didn't pack; a weapon which she's only supposed to use under supervision, and a cryptic note.

[[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] also goes to see if she notices anyone familiar seeing her off. She sees the proprietor of [[Aram's Cantine\|Aram's Cantine]], as well as his grandmother. She also sees [[Moe\|Moe]], the proprietor of the small theatre. She makes a quick drawing of them and folds it into an airplane and throws it at them, but misses. She then approaches [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] and asks if his bird, [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]], could deliver the note.

When [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] unpacks her luggage, she finds a [[Lore/Moska's Note\|note]] as well as 200 rukh and a gun. 

[[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] moves to meet with [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]] and [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] to show them around, and finds that they were also given guns. When they look for [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]], he isn't in his room, so they quickly go search him to make sure he's on the ship. This ship is way more luxurious than the ones [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] had seen before, the travel probably houses a few big names. They eventually find [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] at the bar, he's drinking, thinks the drinks are free, they are not. They let him finish his drink and then go to the lounge to watch the ship departure. 

[[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] also move back to their rooms, where [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] finds a copy of her contract and the supplies she requested, and [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] also finds a note from his mother.

[[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] joins the others at the viewing deck, and can finally see his mother in the crowd. A lot of people are gathered there, waving at the greatship, mostly younger ones. The adults seem to keep their composure more, and seem to be mostly [[Lore/Coriolites\|Coriolites]]. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] asks a woman in a silver masks why there are so many [[Lore/Coriolites\|Coriolites]], she says this expedition was entirely funded by five big [[Lore/Coriolites\|Coriolites]], which doesn't usually happen. She introduces herself as [[Ami Alamasi\|Ami Alamasi]].

After the ship's departure, a few of the [[Lore/Coriolites\|Coriolites]] aboard take of their masks as if a ritual has just finished. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] finds [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] to give him a drawing of [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]], who immediately launches into a lecture on [[Lore/Garuda\|Garuda]]. Misunderstandings were had about opening up and killing [[Characters/Kestrel\|Kestrel]]. The crew overhears the conversation and they join up again.

[[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] explains that officially he is on a spiritual journey to find faith. He doesn't explain the unofficial reason. After a little further introduction [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] asks [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] for a bit of a tour of the ship. Even though this greatship is a lot more fancily decorated, the layout seems to be about the same as the other greatships [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]] has been on, it even seems a little smaller. They move to the back of the ship where the carpet disappears, and they find the mooring points, where [[Echo's Light\|Echo's Light]] seems to be moored. It's weird that it's here since none of them knew about it. There also only seem to be 6 mooring points here, of which 5 are occupied; Echo's Light, 2 silver gleaming shuttles (very posh), one rickety ship with chipped off paint, and one with the same colour pattern as [[Locations/The Zalos\|The Zalos]]. Usually there are more than 10.

A young man asks what they are doing in the mooring bay, they ask him why the Echo's Light. He brings an older man over to us who leaves through a log and tells us it was boarded on orders of [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]] of the Explorers' Guild. 

[[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] asks the group who is going to the lecture on Moubarra the following day. Most of them seem to be going. 

They continue on the tour, mostly past cabins and workshops. Also an infirmary, and the other lounge.  They do eventually see a staircase that leads up to the bridge, but only personnel is permitted. [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] visits the library to try and do some research on the Dara family, but finds mostly religious texts. [[Characters/Ava Aquilar\|Ava]], [[Characters/Selene Dara\|Selene]], and [[NPC's/Ship City/Clemence Dukus\|Clemence]] start on their physical training, and [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] goes to her room to tinker on some art.

At 18:00 a gong goes off to indicate dinner is served. Everyone moves to the [[Dining Hull\|Dining Hull]]. [[Characters/Veronica Buttons\|Veronica]] notices [[NPC's/Ship City/Julia Golgayad Mirmira\|Julia]]'s son, who she sits with, [[Characters/Dorian Golgayad\|Dorian]] spots representatives of practically all powerful Coriolite families, as well as the current heads of the Nazar family, who he thinks the silver shuttles in the mooring bay belong to. He ends up sitting at a table with some other [[Lore/Coriolites\|Coriolites]], but doesn't talk to them. The others go sit together.

Around 19:00, a woman, the Captain Albay; [[NPC's/Zalos/Demet Ashur\|Demet Ashur]], in red and white, and the captain from before, [[NPC's/Zalos/Captain Atsæmæz\|Captain Atsæmæz]] in white and blue introduce themselves and open a concert in honour of the Traveler. An early start to the evening's mass. A bowl goes around collecting small pieces of knotted rope as offering, getting collected at the stage and lit into a small bonfire.
