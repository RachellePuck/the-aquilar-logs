## Specialty
***Wreck Diver***
> You had a knack for spotting entry points and deciphering blueprints just by looking at an old wreck. To you, every wreck was an intriguing spatial puzzle. Squeezing through tight spaces without damaging your exo-suit, you were always the first to find and secure treasures for your crewmates. With tools to cut, pry, and bend hull plates – or set precise charges to separate entire sections – you proved your skill in both reading schematics and the practical art of dismantling wrecks.

**Free Talent:** Exo-Specialist

# Backstory
Quite some time ago, Ava's grandfather, [[NPC's/Dacaro Aquilar\|Dacaro Aquilar]], was a well renowned explorer and map maker. He led many an expedition and charted large swaths of the Charted Sphere, until one day he disappeared, his crew claiming he was with them one moment and gone the next. Ava remembers Dacaro telling her stories of his adventures and she was enraptured by the tales of exploration and the ancient ruins they found along the way, and from the exact moment of his disappearance, she started dreaming of a maze-like structure.
When [[NPC's/Dacaro Aquilar\|Dacaro]] disappeared, his son and Ava's father, Dinan Aquilar lost himself in alcohol and drugs in his sorrow, and he and his family were sent to the Far Colonies to work off the debts he'd accumulated. When Ava was old enough to work, she put her affinity for mapping tunnels to good use in the mines. She worked hard and eventually found her way back to [[Locations/Ship City/Ship City\|Ship City]], where she begged [[NPC's/Ship City/Master Moska\|Master Moska]] to let her explore the Lost Horizon like her grandfather had done.
Ava mostly worked on salvage in the mean time, bringing in anything valuable from wrecked ships, studying blueprints and knowing the exact routes to take for the crew to go in and out with the least resistance.
The maze in her dreams never stopped appearing, and Ava spent many nights wandering the halls and tunnels of this place she'd never been. She sketched out maps of the routes she'd taken, and eventually had these tattoo'd onto and around her fore-arms and on her back. Thin lines, seeming like nothing but an abstract jumble to most people who looked at them, but to her a maze she had been dreaming of so long, it had become part of her.
